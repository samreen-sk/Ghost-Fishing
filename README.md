## Problem Statement : GHOST FISHING GEAR DETECTION​
## Brief about the idea
### Ghost Fishing: A Threat to Marine Life​
What if the fishing nets we left behind never stopped catching? Even years later, they continue to trap and kill marine life. Ghost fishing occurs when abandoned, lost, or discarded fishing gear keeps harming marine species, causing irreversible damage. An estimated 25,000 nets are discarded annually in the Northeast Atlantic alone, some weighing up to 10,000 pounds. These nets pollute the ocean, disrupt ecosystems, and deplete fish populations, threatening the balance of marine biodiversity. The retrieval process is dangerous, slow, and costly, leaving much of the waste uncollected.​
Ghost fishing occurs when abandoned, lost, or discarded fishing gear (ALDFG) continues to trap marine life indiscriminately. These ghost nets, often made of non-biodegradable plastics, account for 640,000 tons of marine debris annually. They harm ecosystems by:

1. Entangling and killing marine animals like turtles, dolphins, and fish.
2. Damaging coral reefs and seafloor habitats.
3. Contributing to microplastic pollution, infiltrating the food chain and threatening human health.

This issue directly aligns with UN Sustainable Development Goal 14: Life Below Water, which aims to conserve and sustainably use oceans, seas, and marine resources. Ghost fishing undermines efforts to reduce marine pollution, restore ecosystems, and promote sustainable fisheries.
